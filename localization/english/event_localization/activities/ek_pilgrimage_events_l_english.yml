I've noticed a trail of blood coming from the feet of some pilgrims and I've wondered about that until I stopped one of them to ask them if they needed a physician.\n\nWith a sigh and a pained voice, [hetman.GetSheHe] answered me that was a proof of devotion to the Tribunal. They were using special footwear that pierced and cut their feet, to make them feel the pain of the martyrs.
